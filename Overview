Overview

This project provides a controlled Intrusion Detection Lab using VirtualBox with a host-only network configuration. It features two virtual machines: KaliAttacker (Kali Linux Purple Edition), equipped with penetration testing tools, and UbuntuDefender (Ubuntu Desktop) running Snort IDS. The host-only adapter ensures complete isolation from external networks, allowing safe experimentation with attack-defense scenarios.

The lab is designed for cybersecurity training, research, and hands-on practice, enabling users to:

    Simulate real-world network attacks in a secure environment

    Monitor and analyze traffic using Snort IDS

    Develop and test custom detection rules

    Strengthen understanding of intrusion detection concepts

This setup offers a practical platform for students, professionals, and researchers to explore both offensive and defensive security techniques without risk to production systems.
